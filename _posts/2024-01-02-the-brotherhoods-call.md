title: "Journal 476|A - The Brotherhood's Call"
---

The brotherhood calls on me again. Now in the form of Silas. As a paladin of the Seven Sisters and agent of the brotherhood, I find his letter an embarrassment to my oath, but I cannot afford to turn him down. Mercenary work allows me to protect those in need, and if this work will save souls, even better.
