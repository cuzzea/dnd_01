title: "Journal 476|A - The Brotherhood's Call"
excerpt: "A conflicted paladin of Selune receives a questionable request from Silas of the Brotherhood, weighing their sacred oath against the practical needs of mercenary work and the greater good of saving souls."

The brotherhood calls on me again. Now in the form of Silas. As a paladin of the Selune and agent of the brotherhood of The Lords Aliance, I find his letter an embarrassment to my oath, but I cannot afford to turn him down. Mercenary work allows me to protect those in need, and if this work will save souls, even better.

May Selune guide me,

Artemis
