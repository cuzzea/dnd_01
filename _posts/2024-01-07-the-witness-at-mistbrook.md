excerpt: "A militia sergeant's eyewitness account of paladin Artemis's fall at Mistbrook, and how his sacrifice led to an unexpected blessing from Selune herself."
---



I was there at Mistbrook when the noble paladin fell. Artemis, for all his gleaming armor and bold words, never saw it coming. The cultists of Shar didn't just bring numbers - they brought darkness itself. Five to one, he said with such confidence that morning. If only he knew they were merely the bait.

The battle started as he planned - him at the front, cutting through cultists with impressive skill. But when the drums stopped and that unnatural silence fell over the battlefield, even the bravest villagers felt their hearts grow cold. The thing that emerged from their ranks... I've never seen anything like it. Towering, wrapped in shadows that seemed to drink in Selune's moonlight, with eyes that glowed like dying stars.

Artemis charged it, of course. His blade flashing with silvery radiance, war cry echoing across the village square. The old cleric of Selune with the moonstone amulet screamed a warning, but he wouldn't listen. Never even saw the tendrils of shadow magic that wrapped around him until it was too late.

They say pride goes before a fall. In Artemis's case, it was literal. His armor didn't just break - it shattered like glass, each piece reflecting the phases of the moon overhead as he fell. Strange, really. That was the moment the tide turned, though not how anyone expected. As his blood soaked into the earth, it began to glow with the Moonmaiden's light. The moon itself seemed to pulse in response, trailing tears of both joy and sorrow.

What happened next... well, that's why I'm writing this. People need to know that sometimes death is just the beginning. The Night White Lady doesn't just choose her champions - sometimes she remakes them entirely.
