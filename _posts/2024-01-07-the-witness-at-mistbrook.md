title: "Journal 136|O - The Witness at Mistbrook"
---

I was there at Mistbrook when the noble paladin fell. Artemis, for all his gleaming armor and bold words, never saw it coming. The cultists didn't just bring numbers - they brought darkness itself. Five to one, he said with such confidence that morning. If only he knew they were merely the bait.

The battle started as he planned - him at the front, cutting through cultists with impressive skill. But when the drums stopped and that unnatural silence fell over the battlefield, even the bravest villagers felt their hearts grow cold. The thing that emerged from their ranks... I've never seen anything like it. Towering, wrapped in shadows that seemed to drink in the light, with eyes that glowed like dying stars.

Artemis charged it, of course. His blade flashing in the dim light, war cry echoing across the village square. The old woman with the moonstone amulet screamed a warning, but he wouldn't listen. Never even saw the tendrils of darkness that wrapped around him until it was too late.

They say pride goes before a fall. In Artemis's case, it was literal. His armor didn't just break - it shattered like glass, each piece reflecting the seven moons overhead as he fell. Strange, really. That was the moment the tide turned, though not how anyone expected. As his blood soaked into the earth, it began to glow with a silvery light. The moons - all seven of them - seemed to pulse in response.

What happened next... well, that's why I'm writing this. People need to know that sometimes death is just the beginning. The Sisters of the Moon don't just choose their champions - sometimes they remake them entirely.
