We cautiously stepped into the expansive chamber, the air heavy with an eerie stillness. Before us loomed a massive entity, an amorphous mass seemingly composed of countless eyes, each one blinking and swiveling with unnerving awareness. Enia took the lead, moving forward to assess whether the creature posed a threat.

Without warning, the thing surged towards her, lashing out in a swift, coordinated attack. Enia barely had time to react as she was struck, forcing her to retreat rapidly while sustaining another injury. Richard didn't hesitateâ€”he fired a precise shot from his gun, the bullet finding its mark amidst the chaos. Meanwhile, Grock's fury ignited, his form expanding to twice its normal size, muscles bulging as he prepared to confront the threat head-on.

The thing shifted its form, enveloping itself in front of Enia in a protective gesture, as if recognizing her value to us. Drawing my moonsilver longblade, I charged forward to intercept the creature's assault. It  lashed out like a bull, catching me across my chest and shoulder. The impact sent me spinning backwards, my armor crackling as it absorbed part of the blow. Blood trickled down my arm, but I maintained my defensive stance, buying Enia precious seconds to retreat.

The creature's surface rippled with malevolent intelligence, its countless eyes tracking our every movement. I felt the creature's assault firsthand, taking significant damage that left me reeling. My vision blurred from the pain, but I could still make out Enia's graceful form as she tumbled away from danger. Despite my injuries, Enia managed to escape the immediate danger, but not without consequence. As the battle raged, Grock engaged the larger blob but was tragically consumed by the creature's voracious appetite, but not before he managed to deliver a devastating blow.

Enia and I fought tirelessly against the smaller manifestations the goo spawned, Richard unleashing a massive wave of darkness that swallowed the battlefield in pitch blackness. Visibility was obliterated, and Richard's eyes reverted to their ominous black void, reflecting the overwhelming darkness he commanded. Through sheer determination, we eradicated all the monsters, but the loss of Grock weighed heavily on us as we discovered him nearly devoured by the beast.

Richard was visibly shaken by the loss, his demeanor darkened by grief. Drawing upon my connection to Selune, I performed the sacred rites of preservation. Under the Moonmaiden's silver light streaming through the chamber's high windows, I cast **Gentle Repose**, infusing Grock's body with the protective essence of Our Lady of Silver. The moonlight seemed to shimmer around his form, ensuring his body would remain untouched by time's decay for ten days - a blessing often granted to fallen warriors who die far from home.

As I stood beside Grock's remains, I whispered the Oath of the Waning Gibbous: "I offer myself as a beacon of the Moonmaiden's light, accepting both her blessings and duties." The familiar blue-white glow of Selune's power emanated softly from my hands as I completed the ritual. *I must find a way to help Richard come to terms with his loss. By the light of the Moon, we shall honor Grock's sacrifice and continue to shield those who cannot shield themselves.*
