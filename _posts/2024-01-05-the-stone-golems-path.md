title: "Journal 531|T - The Stone Golem's Path"
---

The strangers finally revealed their names - Richard, the one with those unsettling dark eyes that seem to pierce through souls, and his companion Grock, who bears two massive gauntlets that would make even a giant envious. The tension in the chamber was palpable as they explained their presence in these depths.

It was only when we reached the sealed chamber that their true expertise became apparent. The grinding of stone against stone heralded the awakening of the stone golem, its crystalline eyes flickering to life with an inner blue flame. Their familiarity with the stone golem that now guides us raises more questions than answers. The construct moves with purpose, as if it knows these halls intimately. 

The stone golem's crystalline eyes pulsed with that mesmerizing blue flame as it led us back through the winding passages, stopping before an unmarked doorway. Enia melted into the shadows with her characteristic grace, slipping through the entrance. Moments later, her whispered all-clear drew us forward. Beyond the threshold, a magnificent hallway stretched before us, its walls adorned with elaborate dwarven paintings that chronicled tales of their ancient civilization. The artistry, though faded by centuries, still held an undeniable power - scenes of great battles, mystical forges, and what appeared to be ritual ceremonies danced across the stone surfaces in faded pigments of gold and deep earth tones.

What troubles my spirit more are the blood marks we found near the door at the passage's end. Richard... his methods are unlike any magic I've witnessed in all my years. He carries strange bindings of paper, held together by impossibly thin metal strips, containing vivid images that seem to capture moments in time with unnatural precision. The markings accompanying these images - they resemble no script I know.

While waiting, we took the opportunity to examine the chamber more closely. Richard's keen eyes spotted unusual wear patterns in the stonework near one of the corners. Upon closer inspection, we discovered a smaller doorway, barely tall enough for a dwarf, cleverly concealed behind a section of worked stone. The door itself radiated magic - I could feel the familiar tingling of protective wards, though their nature seemed different from any I'd encountered before. While Grock was able to identify the magic protecting it, Richard approached it with that unsettling confidence of his, producing one of his strange bound papers and studying the magical barrier with intense focus.

When he spoke words in a tongue that made my teeth ache, the magical barrier simply... yielded. The Sister of the Dark Moon must be laughing at my confusion, for surely this is the kind of mystery she delights in presenting to her followers. Though the newly revealed stairway beckons downward, we agreed to investigate the chamber with the blood marks first. Enia's instincts mirror my own on this - whatever left those stains requires our immediate attention.

The Sister of the First Quarter's teachings ring clear - "reveal what must be known, shroud what must remain hidden." Yet I find myself wondering which category Richard's strange powers fall into. These are dangerous times to harbor such uncertainties.
