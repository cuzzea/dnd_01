excerpt: "A chilling account of exploring ancient ruins, where fresh corpses with unnatural tentacles lay scattered around a grand table, guided by an elven boy."

Enia is the most annoying elf I ever worked with. The constant shadow hiding and appearing in your face is getting on my nerves. I do admit that his story is full of darkness outside of his control, but I am afraid that the darkness made its way inside and is eating at her soul. No mather, I trust in Selune to show only what is needed, even if it's temporary. Even with that said, without their guidance I would of released her the moment we meet if not for their guidance and signs. Nevertheless, we have a job to do, and even more than the job, an obligation bestowed upon me by Selune herself. My hart should be empty of doubts and only focus should remain.

The only thing I dread more than warm ale is his eyes. I have seen many atrocities in my journeys, but this being is not something I could even imagine. His attitude certain common politeness is not something displayed by normal people of this world. I had kings and queens show more common decency than this strange human.

Selune's mark appeared twice before meeting them - first as a shadow cast by no visible source, then as a perfect crescent in spilled blood. It seems she guides our steps, as each wrong turn revealed another sign of her presence in the scattered moonstone shards.

After talking with Sithlar, we ventured into the ruins. Down the first flight of stairs, a vast chamber opened before us, its floor marked by tracks in ancient dust leading to a right-hand door. Another descent brought us to a chamber that would haunt even the bravest soul - a grand table surrounded by chairs, fresh corpses strewn about like discarded dolls, some bearing tentacles that had no right to exist on human flesh. The sounds drew us to another door, where we encountered a young elven boy who seemed to serve as their attendant. His refusal to speak common tongue grated on my nerves, though Enia's intervention revealed he meant no harm - they shared some elvish dialect I couldn't grasp. At least he had the courtesy to guide us to where the two adventurers had holed up, giving them ample time to make themselves presentable, or whatever business delayed them.
