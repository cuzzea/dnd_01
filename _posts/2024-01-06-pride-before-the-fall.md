excerpt: "A prideful noble's final journal entry before defending Mistbrook village, dismissing warnings and reinforcements in pursuit of personal glory and recognition"
---



The drums of war echo through Mistbrook, but my spirit soars with anticipation. These cultists think their numbers will overwhelm us - five to one, they say. Let them come. My blade thirsts for righteous combat, and my armor gleams like the morning sun. The common folk look to me with such admiration, as they should. After all, how many nobles would stand here, ready to defend a simple village?

The militia captain, poor fellow, keeps fretting about waiting for reinforcements. He doesn't understand that glory waits for no one. And those Sel√ªnite priests with their endless warnings about dark omens and lunar alignments - honestly, what nonsense. Give me steel and courage over superstition any day. My training at the Radiant Order taught me all I need to know - evil falls before righteousness, always.

I've organized the defenses myself. The strongest villagers will hold the barricades while I lead from the front. My reputation will only grow after tomorrow's victory. Perhaps they'll even write songs about this - "The Noble Defender of Mistbrook." Has a nice ring to it, doesn't it?

Some old priestess of Our Lady of Silver tried to gift me a moonstone amulet for protection. I politely declined - my faith in the light and my own blade are all the protection I need. These country folk and their devotion to the Moonmaiden... charming, but ultimately unnecessary. Tomorrow's victory will prove that true strength lies in steel and training, not in watching the night sky for signs.
