excerpt: "A paladin's mystical near-death experience under Selune's full moon leads to visions of the goddess herself, marking the beginning of a profound spiritual transformation"

The healers tell me I died for seven heartbeats during the battle. Seven heartbeats under Selune's full moon. They speak of signs and portents, but I know what I saw in those moments between life and death was Our Lady of Silver herself, her form shifting like the phases of the moon - at once young and ancient, radiant with that characteristic blue-white glow.

My paladin training never prepared me for this. The code, the combat, the rigid structures - they seem shallow now compared to these deeper mysteries. The head cleric, Serra, says my survival was no accident. She speaks of a greater purpose, of the balance between martial prowess and Selune's divine grace.

I must rest now. The moon is rising, and its light calls to me in ways I cannot yet understand. Whether vision or blessing from the Moonmaiden, I feel changed. The warrior in me wants to dismiss these experiences, but something deeper knows - this is only the beginning.
