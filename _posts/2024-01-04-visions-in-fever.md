title: "Journal 137|M - Visions in Fever"
---

The fever still burns through my veins, yet the moonlight soothes like a mother's touch. These clerics speak of the Sisters as if they walk among us. In my delirium last night, I saw them - all seven, their forms shifting like smoke under starlight. The Sister of the Waxing Crescent reached for me, her touch cool against my burning skin. "Shield those who cannot shield themselves," she whispered, and for a moment, I thought I glimpsed the truth behind her veil.

The healers tell me I died for seven heartbeats during the battle. Seven heartbeats during a lunar convergence. They speak of signs and portents, but I know what I saw was merely the product of blood loss and healing herbs. Yet... when I close my eyes, I can still see the crescent mark she left on my palm, glowing with an inner light that pulses in time with the phases of the moon.

My paladin training never prepared me for this. The code, the combat, the rigid structures - they seem shallow now compared to these deeper mysteries. The head cleric, Serra, says my survival was no accident. She speaks of a greater purpose, of bridges between martial prowess and divine grace.

I must rest now. The moons are rising, and their light calls to me in ways I cannot yet understand. Whether vision or madness, I feel changed. The warrior in me wants to dismiss these experiences, but something deeper knows - this is only the beginning.
