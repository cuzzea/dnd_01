excerpt: "Artemis is shocked by the revelation of "John" being shrouded in dark and alos the message from Selune telling him to abandon this path, abandon this lost soul."

The shadows and the darkness, the dread and the fear, the unknown and the unseen. All of these are the things that we face every day, and yet we stand strong against them. We are the light in the darkness, the hope in the despair, the courage in the face of fear. We are the children of Selune, and we will not be defeated. Even all these things combined, flooding my mind at the same time, I was prepared. I was ready to face whatever was coming my way. I was ready to face the truth. And all of them did come, all at once, in a single moment of revelation. But I was not prepared for what I felt next.

The revelation came to me in a flash of light, a blinding burst of energy that seared through my mind and soul. It was like a bolt of lightning, striking me down with its power and intensity. I felt the touch of Selune's hand upon my shoulder, her voice whispering without words, her presence surrounding me with an otherworldly chill - like standing in the crisp air of a winter's night under her full moon. The cold seeped deep into my bones, carrying her unmistakable warning, her divine command to venture no further into these shadows.

This was not the first time I had felt the touch of Selune's presence. In the past, it had been a comforting and reassuring feeling, a reminder of her guidance and protection. But this time, it was different. This time, it was a warning. A warning that I was treading too close to the edge of the unknown, that I was pushing myself too far into the darkness. This was the thing I was not prepared for. A feeling of dread and foreboding washed over me, a sense of impending doom that I could not shake. I knew that I had to turn back, to retreat from the darkness and the shadows. But I could not bring myself to do it.

My years of service to Selune have taught me that she works in cycles, like the phases of the moon itself. Could this be a test of faith? A deeper lesson about protection - perhaps not of John, but from him? Or perhaps... No. The thought chills me more than the winter air - could something else be masquerading as my patron's guidance?

My oath burns in my memory: "I shall shield wanderers and seekers, as the growing moon guides travelers in darkness." Yet here I stand, divine command seemingly at odds with the very principles I've sworn to uphold. John is the LOST - and by all my teachings, that should make him exactly the sort of soul I'm meant to help.

My hand grips the holy symbol at my chest, feeling its familiar contours. Whatever the truth may be, one thing remains certain - darkness surrounds John like a shroud, and Selune's warning cannot be ignored. But neither can my oaths.
