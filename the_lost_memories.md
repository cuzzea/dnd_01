# The lostt memories of Artemis

## Prologue

During the last exodus of the Seventh Eclipse, many artefacts have been collected by the brotherhood of the sigil. This represents a collection of the most strange and unexplained tales that can be shared with the general people outside the brotherhood, without needing a seal of light.
The memoirs seem to be kept by one individual, named Artemis, or somebody that might of been part of hist party and are found scattered all over the land, from the depths of the Shadowspine Mountains to the shores of the Twilight Sea. The manuscripts vary wildly in their making - some written on ancient parchment with silver ink, others carved into moon-blessed bark, and a few etched onto sheets of strange, opalescent metal. It seems that this specific individual was not concerned about the safety of the memoirs and he did not have the intention of keeping them. We do presume that if not lost, the memoirs would be burned by the writer as a form of release, as we found partial charred remains of what seem to be similar memoirs from the same author. The memoirs are not presented chronologically, but instead how they were found and stored.
We, as the publishers of these manuscript, want to inform you, the reader, that what you will read here is not verified and we consider most of this to be the ramblings of a mad worshiper of the 7 sisters. With that being said, in our research, we did find traces of his stories dating over a millennia, accounts described by him being reported as far as the age of Choros. The most recent of these manuscripts was discovered in the Year of the Seventh Moon (1157 by Imperial Reckoning), bearing ink still fresh as morning dew.
The first edition of this manuscript will mostly contain the writings found around Phandalin, the epicenter of the old Netherese Obelisk. These fragments were discovered in various states - some buried beneath rubble in abandoned mines, others hidden within the hollow spaces of ancient walls, and a particularly interesting collection found in a sealed chest within the Stonehill Inn's cellar. While these memoirs seem to be related to the rumors of the underground city, no concrete evidence has been found so far linking them to the whispered tales of vast chambers and forgotten halls beneath Phandalin's streets.

## Jurnal 476|A

The brotherhood calls on me again. Now in the form of Silas, a ... . I find his letter an embarrassment to my outh, my real oath, but I can't aford to turn him down. Mercenary work is the only work I can do now, and if this work will allow me save a few souls, even better. Otherwise I will just be content with the payment and the work.

May the light of the 7 moons guide me.

## Jurnal 531|S

Sim is the most annoying elf I ever worked with. The constant shadow hiding and apearing in your face is getting on my nerves. I do admit that his story is full of darkness outside of his controll, but I am afraid that the darkness made its way inside and is eating at her soul. No mather, I trust in the Sister of the First Quarter to show only what is needed and the Sister of the Waxing Crescent to leave her in my protection, even if it's temporary. Even with that said, without their guidance I would of released her the moment we meet if not for their guidance and signs. Nevertheless, we have a job to do, and even more than the job, an obligation bestowed upon me by the Sister of the Dark Moon herself. My hart should be empty of doubts and only focus should remain.

The only thing I dread more than warm ale is his eyes. I have seen many atrocities in my journeys, but this being is not something I could even imagine. His attitude certain common politeness is not something displayed by normal people of this world. I had kings and queens show more common decency than this strange human.
The Sister of the New Moon's mark appeared twice before meeting them - first as a shadow cast by no visible source, then as a perfect crescent in spilled blood. Even the Sister of Secrets seemed to guide our steps, as each wrong turn revealed another sign of her presence in the scattered moonstone shards.
After talking with Sithlar, we ventured into the ruins. Down the first flight of stairs, a vast chamber opened before us, its floor marked by tracks in ancient dust leading to a right-hand door. Another descent brought us to a chamber that would haunt even the bravest soul - a grand table surrounded by chairs, fresh corpses strewn about like discarded dolls, some bearing tentacles that had no right to exist on human flesh. The sounds drew us to another door, where we encountered a young elven boy who seemed to serve as their attendant. His refusal to speak common tongue grated on my nerves, though Sim's intervention revealed he meant no harm - they shared some elvish dialect I couldn't grasp. At least he had the courtesy to guide us to where the two adventurers had holed up, giving them ample time to make themselves presentable, or whatever business delayed them.
