# The lost memories of Artemis

## Prologue

During the last exodus of the Seventh Eclipse, many artefacts have been collected by the brotherhood of the sigil. This represents a collection of the most strange and unexplained tales that can be shared with the general people outside the brotherhood, without needing a seal of light.

The memoirs seem to be kept by one individual, named Artemis, or somebody that might of been part of hist party and are found scattered all over the land, from the depths of the Shadowspine Mountains to the shores of the Twilight Sea. The manuscripts vary wildly in their making - some written on ancient parchment with silver ink, others carved into moon-blessed bark, and a few etched onto sheets of strange, opalescent metal. It seems that this specific individual was not concerned about the safety of the memoirs and he did not have the intention of keeping them. We do presume that if not lost, the memoirs would be burned by the writer as a form of release, as we found partial charred remains of what seem to be similar memoirs from the same author. The memoirs are not presented chronologically, but instead how they were found and stored.

We, as the publishers of these manuscript, want to inform you, the reader, that what you will read here is not verified and we consider most of this to be the ramblings of a mad worshiper of Selune. With that being said, in our research, we did find traces of his stories dating over a millennia, accounts described by him being reported as far as the age of Choros. The most recent of these manuscripts was discovered in the Year of the Seventh Moon (1157 by Dale Reckoning), bearing ink still fresh as morning dew.

The first edition of this manuscript will mostly contain the writings found around Phandalin, the epicenter of the old Netherese Obelisk. These fragments were discovered in various states - some buried beneath rubble in abandoned mines, others hidden within the hollow spaces of ancient walls, and a particularly interesting collection found in a sealed chest within the Stonehill Inn's cellar. While these memoirs seem to be related to the rumors of the underground city, no concrete evidence has been found so far linking them to the whispered tales of vast chambers and forgotten halls beneath Phandalin's streets.

## Journal 476|A - The Brotherhood's Call
[desc: A conflicted paladin of Selune receives a questionable request from Silas of the Brotherhood, weighing their sacred oath against the practical needs of mercenary work and the greater good of saving souls.]

The brotherhood calls on me again. Now in the form of Silas. As a paladin of the Selune and agent of the brotherhood of The Lords Aliance, I find his letter an embarrassment to my oath, but I cannot afford to turn him down. Mercenary work allows me to protect those in need, and if this work will save souls, even better.

May Selune guide me,

## Journal 531|S - Strange Companions in Dark Places

[desc: A chilling account of exploring ancient ruins, where fresh corpses with unnatural tentacles lay scattered around a grand table, guided by an elven boy.]

Enia is the most annoying elf I ever worked with. The constant shadow hiding and appearing in your face is getting on my nerves. I do admit that his story is full of darkness outside of his control, but I am afraid that the darkness made its way inside and is eating at her soul. No mather, I trust in Selune to show only what is needed, even if it's temporary. Even with that said, without their guidance I would of released her the moment we meet if not for their guidance and signs. Nevertheless, we have a job to do, and even more than the job, an obligation bestowed upon me by Selune herself. My hart should be empty of doubts and only focus should remain.

The only thing I dread more than warm ale is his eyes. I have seen many atrocities in my journeys, but this being is not something I could even imagine. His attitude certain common politeness is not something displayed by normal people of this world. I had kings and queens show more common decency than this strange human.

Selune's mark appeared twice before meeting them - first as a shadow cast by no visible source, then as a perfect crescent in spilled blood. It seems she guides our steps, as each wrong turn revealed another sign of her presence in the scattered moonstone shards.

After talking with Sithlar, we ventured into the ruins. Down the first flight of stairs, a vast chamber opened before us, its floor marked by tracks in ancient dust leading to a right-hand door. Another descent brought us to a chamber that would haunt even the bravest soul - a grand table surrounded by chairs, fresh corpses strewn about like discarded dolls, some bearing tentacles that had no right to exist on human flesh. The sounds drew us to another door, where we encountered a young elven boy who seemed to serve as their attendant. His refusal to speak common tongue grated on my nerves, though Enia's intervention revealed he meant no harm - they shared some elvish dialect I couldn't grasp. At least he had the courtesy to guide us to where the two adventurers had holed up, giving them ample time to make themselves presentable, or whatever business delayed them.

## Journal 137|M - Visions in Fever

[desc: A paladin's mystical near-death experience under Selune's full moon leads to visions of the goddess herself, marking the beginning of a profound spiritual transformation]

The healers tell me I died for seven heartbeats during the battle. Seven heartbeats under Selune's full moon. They speak of signs and portents, but I know what I saw in those moments between life and death was Our Lady of Silver herself, her form shifting like the phases of the moon - at once young and ancient, radiant with that characteristic blue-white glow.

My paladin training never prepared me for this. The code, the combat, the rigid structures - they seem shallow now compared to these deeper mysteries. The head cleric, Serra, says my survival was no accident. She speaks of a greater purpose, of the balance between martial prowess and Selune's divine grace.

I must rest now. The moon is rising, and its light calls to me in ways I cannot yet understand. Whether vision or blessing from the Moonmaiden, I feel changed. The warrior in me wants to dismiss these experiences, but something deeper knows - this is only the beginning.

## Journal 531|T - The Stone Golem's Path

[desc: A hidden dwarf-sized doorway protected by strange magic is discovered, while Richard's mysterious abilities raise questions about the true nature of his powers.]

The strangers finally revealed their names - Richard, the one with those unsettling dark eyes that seem to pierce through souls, and his companion Grock, who bears two massive gauntlets that would make even a giant envious. The tension in the chamber was palpable as they explained their presence in these depths.

It was only when we reached the sealed chamber that their true expertise became apparent. The grinding of stone against stone heralded the awakening of the stone golem, its crystalline eyes flickering to life with an inner blue flame. Their familiarity with the stone golem that now guides us raises more questions than answers. The construct moves with purpose, as if it knows these halls intimately. 

The stone golem's crystalline eyes pulsed with that mesmerizing blue flame as it led us back through the winding passages, stopping before an unmarked doorway. Enia melted into the shadows with her characteristic grace, slipping through the entrance. Moments later, her whispered all-clear drew us forward. Beyond the threshold, a magnificent hallway stretched before us, its walls adorned with elaborate dwarven paintings that chronicled tales of their ancient civilization. The artistry, though faded by centuries, still held an undeniable power - scenes of great battles, mystical forges, and what appeared to be ritual ceremonies danced across the stone surfaces in faded pigments of gold and deep earth tones.

What troubles my spirit more are the blood marks we found near the door at the passage's end. Richard... his methods are unlike any magic I've witnessed in all my years. He carries strange bindings of paper, held together by impossibly thin metal strips, containing vivid images that seem to capture moments in time with unnatural precision. The markings accompanying these images - they resemble no script I know.

While waiting, we took the opportunity to examine the chamber more closely. Richard's keen eyes spotted unusual wear patterns in the stonework near one of the corners. Upon closer inspection, we discovered a smaller doorway, barely tall enough for a dwarf, cleverly concealed behind a section of worked stone. The door itself radiated magic - I could feel the familiar tingling of protective wards, though their nature seemed different from any I'd encountered before. While Grock was able to identify the magic protecting it, Richard approached it with that unsettling confidence of his, producing one of his strange bound papers and studying the magical barrier with intense focus.

When he spoke words in a tongue that made my teeth ache, the magical barrier simply... yielded. Our Lady of Silver must be watching with intrigue, for surely this is the kind of mystery she presents to those who seek knowledge under her ever-changing light. Though the newly revealed stairway beckons downward, we agreed to investigate the chamber with the blood marks first. Enia's instincts mirror my own on this - whatever left those stains requires our immediate attention.

The oath of the First Quarter Moon rings in my mind - "Like the half-lit moon, I will guide those lost and illuminate the path ahead." Yet I find myself wondering whether Richard's strange powers are meant to be illuminated or kept in shadow. These are dangerous times to harbor such uncertainties.

## Journal 136|N - Pride Before the Fall

[desc: A prideful noble's final journal entry before defending Mistbrook village, dismissing warnings and reinforcements in pursuit of personal glory and recognition]

The drums of war echo through Mistbrook, but my spirit soars with anticipation. These cultists think their numbers will overwhelm us - five to one, they say. Let them come. My blade thirsts for righteous combat, and my armor gleams like the morning sun. The common folk look to me with such admiration, as they should. After all, how many nobles would stand here, ready to defend a simple village?

The militia captain, poor fellow, keeps fretting about waiting for reinforcements. He doesn't understand that glory waits for no one. And those Sel√ªnite priests with their endless warnings about dark omens and lunar alignments - honestly, what nonsense. Give me steel and courage over superstition any day. My training at the Radiant Order taught me all I need to know - evil falls before righteousness, always.

I've organized the defenses myself. The strongest villagers will hold the barricades while I lead from the front. My reputation will only grow after tomorrow's victory. Perhaps they'll even write songs about this - "The Noble Defender of Mistbrook." Has a nice ring to it, doesn't it?

Some old priestess of Our Lady of Silver tried to gift me a moonstone amulet for protection. I politely declined - my faith in the light and my own blade are all the protection I need. These country folk and their devotion to the Moonmaiden... charming, but ultimately unnecessary. Tomorrow's victory will prove that true strength lies in steel and training, not in watching the night sky for signs.

Glory Awaits,  
Artemis

## Journal 136|O - The Witness at Mistbrook

[desc: A militia sergeant's eyewitness account of paladin Artemis's fall at Mistbrook, and how his sacrifice led to an unexpected blessing from Selune herself.]

I was there at Mistbrook when the noble paladin fell. Artemis, for all his gleaming armor and bold words, never saw it coming. The cultists of Shar didn't just bring numbers - they brought darkness itself. Five to one, he said with such confidence that morning. If only he knew they were merely the bait.

The battle started as he planned - him at the front, cutting through cultists with impressive skill. But when the drums stopped and that unnatural silence fell over the battlefield, even the bravest villagers felt their hearts grow cold. The thing that emerged from their ranks... I've never seen anything like it. Towering, wrapped in shadows that seemed to drink in Selune's moonlight, with eyes that glowed like dying stars.

Artemis charged it, of course. His blade flashing with silvery radiance, war cry echoing across the village square. The old cleric of Selune with the moonstone amulet screamed a warning, but he wouldn't listen. Never even saw the tendrils of shadow magic that wrapped around him until it was too late.

They say pride goes before a fall. In Artemis's case, it was literal. His armor didn't just break - it shattered like glass, each piece reflecting the phases of the moon overhead as he fell. Strange, really. That was the moment the tide turned, though not how anyone expected. As his blood soaked into the earth, it began to glow with the Moonmaiden's light. The moon itself seemed to pulse in response, trailing tears of both joy and sorrow.

What happened next... well, that's why I'm writing this. People need to know that sometimes death is just the beginning. The Night White Lady doesn't just choose her champions - sometimes she remakes them entirely.

## Journal 532|V - The Battle of Many Eyes

[desc: A harrowing battle against a many-eyed creature leads to Grock's tragic fall. Artemis performs sacred rites while Richard grapples with loss under Selune's light.]

We cautiously stepped into the expansive chamber, the air heavy with an eerie stillness. Before us loomed a massive entity, an amorphous mass seemingly composed of countless eyes, each one blinking and swiveling with unnerving awareness. Enia took the lead, moving forward to assess whether the creature posed a threat.

Without warning, the thing surged towards her, lashing out in a swift, coordinated attack. Enia barely had time to react as she was struck, forcing her to retreat rapidly while sustaining another injury. Richard didn't hesitate‚Äîhe fired a precise shot from his gun, the bullet finding its mark amidst the chaos. Meanwhile, Grock's fury ignited, his form expanding to twice its normal size, muscles bulging as he prepared to confront the threat head-on.

The thing shifted its form, enveloping itself in front of Enia in a protective gesture, as if recognizing her value to us. Drawing my moonsilver longblade, I charged forward to intercept the creature's assault. It  lashed out like a bull, catching me across my chest and shoulder. The impact sent me spinning backwards, my armor crackling as it absorbed part of the blow. Blood trickled down my arm, but I maintained my defensive stance, buying Enia precious seconds to retreat.

The creature's surface rippled with malevolent intelligence, its countless eyes tracking our every movement. I felt the creature's assault firsthand, taking significant damage that left me reeling. My vision blurred from the pain, but I could still make out Enia's graceful form as she tumbled away from danger. Despite my injuries, Enia managed to escape the immediate danger, but not without consequence. As the battle raged, Grock engaged the larger blob but was tragically consumed by the creature's voracious appetite, but not before he managed to deliver a devastating blow.

Enia and I fought tirelessly against the smaller manifestations the goo spawned, Richard unleashing a massive wave of darkness that swallowed the battlefield in pitch blackness. Visibility was obliterated, and Richard's eyes reverted to their ominous black void, reflecting the overwhelming darkness he commanded. Through sheer determination, we eradicated all the monsters, but the loss of Grock weighed heavily on us as we discovered him nearly devoured by the beast.

Richard was visibly shaken by the loss, his demeanor darkened by grief. Drawing upon my connection to Selune, I performed the sacred rites of preservation. Under the Moonmaiden's silver light streaming through the chamber's high windows, I cast **Gentle Repose**, infusing Grock's body with the protective essence of Our Lady of Silver. The moonlight seemed to shimmer around his form, ensuring his body would remain untouched by time's decay for ten days - a blessing often granted to fallen warriors who die far from home.

As I stood beside Grock's remains, I whispered the Oath of the Waning Gibbous: "I offer myself as a beacon of the Moonmaiden's light, accepting both her blessings and duties." The familiar blue-white glow of Selune's power emanated softly from my hands as I completed the ritual. *I must find a way to help Richard come to terms with his loss. By the light of the Moon, we shall honor Grock's sacrifice and continue to shield those who cannot shield themselves.*
